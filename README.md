# Eye-For-Blind
In this project, you will be converting the image to text description first and then using a simple text to speech API, the extracted text description/caption will be converted to audio.

Problem Statement Overview:

Today, in the world of social media, millions of images are uploaded daily. Some of them are about your friends and family, while some of them are about nature and its beauty. Imagine a condition where you are not able to see and enjoy these images — a problem that blind people face on a daily basis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it has been reported that there are around 285 million visually impaired people worldwide and out of these 285 million, 39 million are totally blind. 

 

In an initiative to help such people experience the beauty of the images, Facebook had earlier launched a unique feature that can help blind people operate their app on their respective mobile phones and the feature would explain to the blind person the contents of an image that their friends have posted on Facebook. So, say, if someone posted a picture with their dog in the park, the application would speak out the contents and may describe it like, “This image may contain a dog standing with a man around the trees.”

 

In this module, you will understand how a blind person can overcome all these problems and go along with ordinary people when it comes to seeing. You will learn how to make a model similar to what Facebook made, specifically making the blind person know the contents of an image in front of them with a CNN-RNN based model. The model will convert the contents of an image and will give the output in the form of audio.

 

In this project, you will be converting the image to text description first and then using a simple text to speech API, the extracted text description/caption will be converted to audio. So the central part of this capstone is focused on building the caption/text description as the second part, which is transforming the text to speech is relatively easy with the text to speech API. Once the model is built, you will deploy the project on your local system using a Flask based model to generate audio-based content for any image.
